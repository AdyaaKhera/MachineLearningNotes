#include <iostream> //header file library that helps us with input and output
using namespace std; //we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library
int main() { //main function that returns an integer - 0
  cout << "Hello World!"; //prints hello world
  return 0; 
}
// if we don't use the namespace std we can just say std::cout while using cout or other similar objects
// while using these objects we need to declare that they are part of the standard 'std' library
// all c++ statements end with a semi colon
//there are a few ways to inset a new line
cout << "HI! \n";
