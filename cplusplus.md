# C++

## Input and Output
- All c++ statements end with a semi colon
```C++
#include <iostream> //header file library that helps us with input and output
using namespace std; //we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library
int main() { //main function that returns an integer - 0
  cout << "Hello World!"; //prints hello world
  return 0; }
```
- If we don't use the `namespace std` we can just say `std::cout` while using `cout` or other similar objects
- While using these objects we need to declare that they are part of the standard `std` library
- - For inputs, we can use `cin` by using the `>>` operator
  ```C++
  int x;
  cout << "enter number: ";
  cin >> x;
- `cin` considers a space as a terminating character, which means that it can only store a single word even if more than one words are entered
- Both `cin` and `cout` belong to the <iostream> library, which is short for **standard input / output streams**.
  
## Data types
- Variables should be created in the form: `type name = value`

| Data Type | Size         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bool`    | 1 byte       | Stores `true` or `false` values.                                           |
| `char`    | 1 byte       | Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values.                  |
| `int`     | 2 or 4 bytes | Stores whole numbers, without decimals.                                    |
| `float`   | 4 bytes      | Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6â€“7 decimal digits. |
| `double`  | 8 bytes      | Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits. |
| `string`  | Varies       | Stores a sequence of characters (text).           |

- There are a few ways to inset a new line in C++
```C++
cout << "HI! \n";
cout << "HI!" << "\n";
cout << "Hello" << endl;
```
- `\n` is called an **escape sequence** which moves the cursor to the next line.
- To display variables while printing them we use ``<<``
  ```C++
  int age = 20;
  cout << "you are" << age << "years old!";
- The names used for variables are called identifiers
- We can also create constants
  ```C++
  const int pi = 3.14;
- Constants cannot be assigned a value later. It must be done at the time of declaration.
- The datatype `string` is not built-in so we have to include the `<string>` library everytime we want to use it.
- `auto` is a keyword that lets the compiler firgure out the datatype of a variable. So instead of saying `int x = 5;` we can just say `auto x = 5;`
- `auto` only works when the value is assigned at the time of variable declaration
- once a datatype is assigned to a variable, it is fixed.
  
### Strings
- Strings are objects in C++
- Other than using `+`, we can also concatenate strings using `append()` function since it's an object
- the `length()` or `size()` function can be used to find the length of a string
- C++ does not support negative indexing natively
  ```C++
  string myString = "Hello";
  cout << myString[myString.length() - 1];
- We can also use the `at()` function for accessing a character at the particular index
  ```C++
  #include <string>
  string str = "hello";
  cout << str.at(1);
- Since `cin` can only input one word, we use `getline()` function to read a line of text
  ```C++
  cout << "enter variable value";
  getline (cin, variable_name);
- `string` is also an object of the std library
- **C-Style strings** are created using the `char` datatype by creating an array of characters to make a string
  ```C++
  char greeting2[] = "Hello";

## Operators
- `>>=` and `<<=` are shorthand bitwise operators used to shift a bit value to the left or right by a certain number
- Logical Operators are `&&` (and), `||` (or) and `!` (not)
